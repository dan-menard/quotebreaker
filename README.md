This is a quote-decrypting game.

Click on a letter (or tab to it and hit space) to highlight all instances of it, then type whatever letter you think it is and hit Enter to fill them all in.

You can run it like any other Svelte app packaged with rollup:

`npm run dev`

Protip, some versions of OSX have a port conflict on localhost:8080, where this will run by default. You can override that by manually specifying a port:

`PORT=5080 npm run dev`
